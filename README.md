# spritekit-minesweeper

Written right after SpriteKit was released, this PoC shows an example of using SpriteKit animations.

Animated character at random will walk out and drop a bomb down one of the columns which will randomly detonate a tile not already revealed.

Beat the character to solving the puzzle before he bombs your board and hits a mine.
